# Universal Wiki Converter Readme


##  Project forks history
1. START POINT : migration from SVN to GIT
  * URL : https://bitbucket.org/appfusions/universal-wiki-converter
        
2. AppFusions repo was forked by Sorin Sbarnea
  * URL : https://github.com/AtlassianContribs/universal-wiki-converter
  * Motivation : As it seems that pull requests are ignored here, I invite you to try join a real open-source and community driven fork at https://github.com/AtlassianContribs/universal-wiki-converter/wiki

3. Sorin Sbarnea repo was forked by sameertawil
  * URL : https://github.com/sameertawil/universal-wiki-converter
  * Motivation : ...

4. sameertawil repo was forked by Mathieu Saade
  * URL : https://github.com/sameertawil/universal-wiki-converter
  * Motivation : work specifically on xwiki syntax 2.0, and maybe other general improvments


## Possible improvments (no particular order)

* remove Ant files
* apply Maven rules by moving tests to src/test/java
* modularize project in modules, 3 solutions:
  * core + exporters/converters
  * core + 1 module per wiki engine (19)
  * core + 1 module per maintained wiki engine (xwiki) + 1 module for other wiki engines 
* fix bugs and code smells
  * Eclipse warnings (see quality_eclipse_warnings.txt)
  * Sonar analysis (see quality_sonar_analysis.txt)


## Build process

### Ant
To build the UWC use ANT (http://ant.apache.org/):
* cd devel (the devel dir.)
* ant      (the default target will build the UWC under 

Note: you do not need to build the UWC to run it; only if you're doing development work with it. 

To run the newly built UWC
* cd target/uwc/
* chmod a+x *sh
* ./run_uwc_devel.sh

### Maven

```shell
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.atlassian.confluence \
                           -DartifactId=confluence-xmlrpc \
                           -Dversion=5.2.0 \
                           -Dfile=lib/confluence-xmlrpc-wrapper-v5.2.0.jar \
                           -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=net.antonioshome.swing \
                           -DartifactId=treewrapper \
                           -Dversion=1.1.1.1 \
                           -Dfile=lib/treewrapper.jar \
                           -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.jvnet.substance \
                           -DartifactId=substance \
                           -Dversion=2.3final \
                           -Dfile=lib/substance.jar \
                           -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.atlassian.confluence \
                          -DartifactId=sharepoint-wrapper \
						  -Dversion=1.0 \
						  -Dfile=lib/sharepoint-wrapper-1.0.jar \
						  -Dpackaging=jar
```

Don't forget to setup your environment variabls.
```
export JAVA_HOME=/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_51
```

## Sonar analysis 
See http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Maven

1. Go to https://sonarqube.com/ and 
  * Sign in with your GitHub account
  * Generate a user token and keep the value in a private file

2. Add the following pluginGroup & profile to the Maven settings.xml file, either the one located in $MAVEN_HOME/conf or ~/.m2
```xml
    <pluginGroups>
        <pluginGroup>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</pluginGroup>
    </pluginGroups>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>sonarqube</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <sonar.host.url>https://sonarqube.com</sonar.host.url>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
```

3. Run a Sonar analysis (replace the value of $SONAR_TOKEN)
```shell
mvn -Psonarqube -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN clean verify sonar:sonar
```

4. Enjoy the result

## ABOUT THE UWC
This code is open source and is up to date with Atlassian's latest storage format of Atlassian Confluence
(introduced in Confluence 4). We successfully use/run the UWC for Confluence 5.X releases, however, there are *many* flavors and versions of MIGRATE_FROM wikis. 

As such, we feel it is accurate to say that this is "a tool", yet not always the end-to-end solution or silver bullet. Wiki formats are varied, and so please understand that the UWC will get you further along, but there may be post-processing, additional scripting, username database merging, or other things required to assist in the process. 

Please refer to the Wiki Migration Checklist (http://www.appfusions.com/display/Dashboard/Wiki+Migration+Checklist) to educate yourself on what is invoived in a migration. The checklist is not to suggest that all content elements are problematic. They aren't. But some are, and not always the same between different flavors of wikis that are being migrated from.

We do provide paid ongoing small and big support for migrations, depending on needs. Email us at info@appfusions.com and let us know what you are trying to do and we can see if we can help you!  We have many client references too.
